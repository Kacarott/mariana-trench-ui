# Mariana Trench
### UI Theme

A theme inspired by the deepest depths. And we are still sinking.

Designed to go with my [Mariana Trench Syntax Theme](https://github.com/kacarott/mariana-trench-syntax).

I would also recommend my extension [Scroll Fade](https://github.com/kacarott/scroll-fade)
to make the transition between text editor and tab bar more pleasant.

I still need to fine tune a lot of smaller details. Coming soon.

Suggestions welcome!
